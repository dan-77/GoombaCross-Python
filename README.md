# Goomba Cross
This was created using Pygame on Python.
This program is a version Frogger, the player must cross to the other side
of the screen by dodging all of the rockets, and then proceed to the otherside of the river
by going on the lilypads to prevent drowning in the water. 
Everytime the user completes a level in the game it 
gets harder by adding more rockets and lilypads.
